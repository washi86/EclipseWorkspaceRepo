\section*{\begin{center} ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \end{center}}

I am particularly grateful to my supervisor Dr. Celestin Wafo Soh for his
unfailing  support throughout the writing of this thesis. His multiple
advices and suggestions  have considerably enhanced the readability of
earlier drafts. Foremost, his enthusiasm and dedication to research have
been a great source of inspiration.

I have also benefited from the most needed moral support of my family and
friends. Their phone calls and letters have kept me from stress and its
consequences.

I would like to express my sincere appreciation to Dr. Shaungzhang Tu and
Dr Marvin Watts for agreeing to be apart of my committee an also for their guidance in the preparation of this thesis.

Finally, I am very much indebted to Jackson State University for
its financial assistance through the tuition assistance recieved from the Department of Mathematics and Dr. Hyun J. Cho for hiring me as a research assistant for an Enviornmental Science Project.
