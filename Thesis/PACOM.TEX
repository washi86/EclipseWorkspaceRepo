Firstly, we prove two linearization criteria for systems of
two second--order ordinary
differential equations (odes). The first one says that a system of two 
second--order odes is reducible via a point transformation to a linear system
if and only if it admits the four--dimensional abelian Lie algebra 
$L_{4,1}$. The second one states that for a system of
two second--order odes to be lineraizable, it is necessary and sufficient that
it admits the four--dimensional  Lie algebra
$L_{4,2}$ with commutators $[X_i,X_j]=0,\;[X_i,X_4]=X_i,\;i,j=1,2,3$
. The approach used is contructive and enables us to work out 
explicitly the transformation leading to linearization.
Secondly, we give necessary and sufficient conditions under which
a system of two second--order linear odes is reducible to the
free particle equation $x''=0,\;y''=0$. 
The linearization criteria  are then generalized to a system of $n$
($n\ge 2$) second--order odes. Finally, we give examples of how one can
effect linearization for system.
